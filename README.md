# Entanglement power calculator

## English Instruction Document

It is known that entanglement measure, or the so-called entanglement entropy, describes how entangled a given state is. Correspondingly, entanglement power characterizes the capacity of an operator $\hat{U}$ to generate entanglement. It is defined by averaging the entanglement measure of the output states produced by acting $\hat{U}$ on all possible product states.

The definition of entanglement power depends only on the dimensions of the two substates, allowing for a general-purpose program to calculate it. EPcalc is such an implementation: it takes any operator as input and outputs its entanglement power.
